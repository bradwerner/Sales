Program Name: Demand_Sales_Line_Items.sql
Program Description: Build a Demand Sales Query that encompasses the 4 Different queries that currently
exist to reproduce it.  Also go to Line Item Level so we can really have fun with the data
Requestor: Kyle MacKenzie
Developer: Kyle MacKenzie
Tables used
	1. SalesLineItems - This is a View for all Sales Line Items.  It comes from multiple tables
It also contains 2 seperate queries to build a low level look at BOMs and Kits items it detail
Updates: V1 - 11/1/2017
		V2 in Dec 2017 - Found a bug in Blu Dot's general look at Demand Sales.  If an order in GP starts as a quote it would be excluded.  Added code
			and [Original Type] in ('', 'Quote')
		v3 1/8/2017 - Added a field that figures out if it was a Direct Web Outlet sale or not. And added GP retail price to calculate Discounts applied
		v4 - 1/10/2018 - Removed most of the Web Outlet stuff.  Look in version 3 if you need it.
			- Fixed a bug that didn't remove Void Status = Voided.  added the logic sli.[Void Status] = 'Normal'
		v5 - 1/17/2018 - Added another field.  [Requested Ship Date] for CDP analysis.  [Item Class Code] for Gail
		v6 - 3/7/2018 - Added a location table to give us specifics about locations and Customer Classes.  And ITem_Level.
		v7 - 3/14/2018 - Added a [Customer Name from Customer Master], We realized that Wholesale partners and others get a Name with (Customer Name and Number) in it.  So if a customer
			has had orders placed directly in GP and Magento the name will be different
		v8 - 3/15/2018 - Added a join to a Steelcase view with Shipping information.
		v9 - 3/16/2018 - Added even more steelcase join information so we can figure out if we can build Kit Items
		v10 - 3/20/2018 - Added sli.[Document Status] which will tell you if an order is Open (Posted vs UnPosted).  Added field [Original Type] to results and removed it from the where condition.
			This will help us determine if an item was a backorder item or not.  if we pre-filter for it then we can't get backorder.  
		v11 - 3/30/2018 - Customer service requested that we add the '[Requested Ship Date]' at the Order level and not the line item level.  Added the new field [Requested Ship Date from Sales Transaction]
		v12 - 4/18/2018 - Added our new PO Promise date and if it was calculated or from a PO
		v13 - 4/20/2018 - Added Budget Customer Class

Kyle Notes
	1. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'No'.  Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  It is a sale in October that isn't 20% off RETAIL - Normal Web Sale
	2. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'Not Oct'.  Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  Assume It is a non Outlet sales - Normal Web Sale
	3. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'Yes'. Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  Sale in October that is 20% off.  So the No is good - Normal Web Sale
	4. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'No'.  Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  Not a 20% discount and the sale was in October - Legit Web OUtlet Sale
	5. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'Not Oct'.  Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  Outside of October so we will assue Outlet - Legit Web Outlet Sales
	6. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'Yes'. 	Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  It calculates out to a 20 % discount - Normal Web Sale
