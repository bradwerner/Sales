Program Name: Demand_Sales_Line_Items.sql
Program Description: Build a Demand Sales Query that encompasses the 4 Different queries that currently
exist to reproduce it.  Also go to Line Item Level so we can really have fun with the data
Requestor: Kyle MacKenzie
Developer: Kyle MacKenzie
Tables used
	1. SalesLineItems - This is a View for all Sales Line Items.  It comes from multiple tables
It also contains 2 seperate queries to build a low level look at BOMs and Kits items it detail
Updates: V1 - 11/1/2017
		V2 in Dec 2017 - Found a bug in Blu Dot's general look at Demand Sales.  If an order in GP starts as a quote it would 
			be excluded.  Added code and [Original Type] in ('', 'Quote')
		v3 1/8/2017 - Added a field that figures out if it was a Direct Web Outlet sale or not. And added GP retail price 
			to calculate Discounts applied
		v4 - 1/10/2018 - Removed most of the Web Outlet stuff.  Look in version 3 if you need it.
			- Fixed a bug that didn't remove Void Status = Voided.  added the logic sli.[Void Status] = 'Normal'
		v5 - 1/17/2018 - Added another field.  [Requested Ship Date] for CDP analysis.  [Item Class Code] for Gail
		v6 - 3/7/2018 - Added a location table to give us specifics about locations and Customer Classes.  And ITem_Level.
		v7 - 3/14/2018 - Added a [Customer Name from Customer Master], We realized that Wholesale partners and others get a 
			Name with (Customer Name and Number) in it.  So if a customer
			has had orders placed directly in GP and Magento the name will be different
		v8 - 3/15/2018 - Added a join to a Steelcase view with Shipping information.
		v9 - 3/16/2018 - Added even more steelcase join information so we can figure out if we can build Kit Items
		v10 - 3/20/2018 - Added sli.[Document Status] which will tell you if an order is Open (Posted vs UnPosted).  
			Added field [Original Type] to results and removed it from the where condition.
			This will help us determine if an item was a backorder item or not.  if we pre-filter for it then we 
			can't get backorder.  
		v11 - 3/30/2018 - Customer service requested that we add the '[Requested Ship Date]' at the Order level 
			and not the line item level.  Added the new field [Requested Ship Date from Sales Transaction]
		v12 - 4/18/2018 - Added our new PO Promise date and if it was calculated or from a PO
		v13 - 4/20/2018 - Added Budget Customer Class
		v14 - 8/6/2018 - Changed the Date to 2016 to speed up the query.  Plus we don't need all this data
		v15 - 8/14/2018 - MAJOR CHANGES made.  Removed the GP View SalesLineItems from the equation (Performance Issues).  It was the main 
			source of data for the results.  Replaced it with the tables that build the view.  Now there is a Unposted flow
			that Unions the Posted transactions
			In order to improve efficiencies I went straight at the tables and added (Nolock)
			I also removed one field that was not being used.  [Requested Ship Date] - this was at the Line item and won't be updated if Customer Service does someting
				[Invoice Level 1] - I removed this field but it is needed for the Steel Case Shipping Report
		
		V16 - 12/19/2018
		1. Added Unit Cost and Included Service orders
		
		V17 - 1/15/2019
		1. Added Hold, Payment Terms ID and Payment Received fields in the table
		
		V18 - 1/17/2019
		1. Payment recieved id divided by number of items bought under each sop number.
		
		V19 - 1/22/2019
		1. Shortened the SQL code

Kyle Notes
	1. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'No'.  Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  It is a sale in October that isn't 20% off RETAIL - Normal Web Sale
	2. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'Not Oct'.  Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  Assume It is a non Outlet sales - Normal Web Sale
	3. Web Outlet Sale = 'No' and 20/20 Sale = 'Yes'. Originating Subtotal ends in 00 or is Mattress.  Sale in October that is 20% off.  So the No is good - Normal Web Sale
	4. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'No'.  Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  Not a 20% discount and the sale was in October - Legit Web OUtlet Sale
	5. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'Not Oct'.  Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  Outside of October so we will assue Outlet - Legit Web Outlet Sales
	6. Web Outlet Sale = 'Yes' and 20/20 Sale = 'Yes'. 	Originating Subtotal DOES NOT end in 00.  It calculates out to a 20 % discount - Normal Web Sale
