/**********************
Program Name: Invoiced_Sales_Line_Items.sql
Program Description: Invoice Sales down to the line item level.  In order to apply a correct Freight Amount I needed to count the records in each order.
	THat number is used to divide the Freight Amount.  IF there are other fields that need it there is a column called order_row_Count.

Tables used
	1. SalesLineItems - This is a View for all Sales Line Items.  It comes from multiple tables
Updates: V1 - 2/22/2018
		v2 - 3/8/2018 - added the location information and attributes.  Added Item_Level field as well
		v3 - 3/14/2018 - Added a [Customer Name from Customer Master], We realized that Wholesale partners and others get a Name with (Customer Name and Number) in it.  So if a customer
			has had orders placed directly in GP and Magento the name will be different

Updates: V4 - 11/16/2018

1. Created a new view from the tables in GP and not using saleslineitems view to make query more efficient and fast. It reduced the 
   runtime to almost half.
2. Modified Kyle's code to add billing and shipping address and dealer classification for all SOPs.
3. Changed the table a to get data directly from SOP30300 and SOP30200 and not using SalesLineitems view to make query runtime short.


Updates: V5 - 11/16/2018

1. Added Original Number
2. Added join condition in table a sop1.SOPTYPE = sop2.SOPTYPE
3. Modified the join condition while joining header with win table.
4. Using inner join for joining iv to header table

Updates: V6 - 11/20/2018

1. changed the case of the fields to match the old code as many reports on tableau was showing error as tableu is case sensitive.

Updates: V7 - 12/03/2018

1. Getting shipping address from sop30200 instead of rm00102.
2. Joined invoice table with US_ZIP on zipcode to clean the city, state and country field. 
3. Getting data from Magento_Orders and joined fields like Code, Status, coupon_code, Customer_group_id,grand_total to Invoice table.

Updates: V7 - 12/04/2018

1. Removed Grand_Total field from the table.
2. Changed shipping and billing ZIP to show 5 digit zip when country is US else show the original zip of that country
